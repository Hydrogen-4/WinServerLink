# WinServerLink
This small library is part of a much larger project. The intent is to show something small and simple.

I developed this library with the purpuse of creating a direct link to services running on remote machines. 
The intent was to be able to monitor and manipulate the status of the services remotely from another system that was actevily monitoring looking for specific trigger conditions.
The master system monitored conditions and sent signals to services spread cross 38 other remote servers.
